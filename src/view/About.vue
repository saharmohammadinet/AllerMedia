      <p>Hello ðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>
        My name is Sahar, I'm from Iran and I've been living in Denmark for 4
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm working in <strong>Dawn Health</strong> as a frontend developer and also I've
        worked in <strong>Loyaltykey(cashbackapp.dk)</strong> and <strong>Html24</strong>, In
        Iran, I was working as a frontend developer aswell.
      </p>
      <p>Here is link to my Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saharmohammadinet/" target="_blank">Profile.</a></p>
      <p>
        In this Project I used <strong>Vue3</strong>,
        <strong>TypeScript </strong>, and <strong>Vite</strong>, also I used
        <strong>Vue Router</strong> for showing the detail of users, if you
        click on the title of the Story or the image, then you'll redirect to the
        source page of the story but if you click on <strong>Read more</strong> button,
        you'll redirect to the dynamic router and shows short description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you can use the <strong>Search </strong>box to filter Stories, you
        should write more than 3 characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides this project, I would like to implement this project in Nuxt and
        also add some tests test but as I talked to Anna, I was sick and didn't
        have time to do more.
      </p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to get your feedbacks ðŸ˜Š.</p>
      <p>Best Regards <br />Sahar</p>
