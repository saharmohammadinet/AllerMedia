      <p>Hello ðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>
        My name is Sahar, I'm from Iran and I've been living in Denmark for 4
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm working in <strong>Dawn Health</strong> and also I've
        worked in <strong>Loyaltykey</strong> and <strong>Html24</strong>, In
        Iran I was working as frontend developer aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this Project I used <strong>Vue3</strong>,
        <strong>TypeScript </strong>and <strong>Vite</strong>, also I used
        <strong>Vue Router</strong> for showing the detail of users, if you
        click on the title of Story or the image, then you'll redirect to the
        source of story but if you click on <strong>Read more</strong> button,
        you'll redirect to dynamic router and shows short description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you can use <strong>Search </strong>box to filter Stories, you
        should write more than 3 characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside this project, I would like to impelement this project in Nuxt and
        also add some unit test but as I talked to Anna, I was sick and didn't
        have time to do more
      </p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to get your feedbacks ðŸ˜Š.</p>
      <p>Best Regards <br />Sahar</p>
