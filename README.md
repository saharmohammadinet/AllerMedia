# Hacker news

Coding challenge, create a webpage that displays 10 random Hacker News stories using the Hacker News API. The stories must be listed in ascending order based on the stories score.

I used ##Vue3, ##TypeScript, and ##Vite, also I used ##Vue ##Router for showing the detail of each story, 
If you click on the title of the Story or the image, then you'll redirect to the source page of the story but if you click on the "Read more" button, you'll redirect to the dynamic router and show a short description. 

Also, you can use the Search box to filter Stories, you should write more than 3 characters.

## Setup

1. Clone the project
1. Install node, e.g. with `brew install nodejs`
1. Install node packages by running `sudo npm install`
1. Run the project by `npm run dev`

Then access <a href="http://localhost:5173/">http://localhost:5173/</a> in your browser.
